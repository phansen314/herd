## 2026-07-18 — No Claude-invoked pager; the escalation stub is deleted {#pager}

Considered giving herd a pager Claude could invoke — a CLI verb plus a skill, so a
session could raise itself deliberately instead of waiting for the derived `!`.
Rejected, along with the softer `herd say "<reason>"` variant that would have
attached a reason string rather than a notification.

**Rejected — redundant.** Claude already signals "done/blocked" by ending its turn:
`stop.sh` → `waiting` → terminal bell → `!` one threshold later. A command Claude
calls immediately before stopping fires seconds earlier carrying the same fact.

**Rejected — blind to the only real gap.** The one case ambient attention misses is
a session gone silently stuck in `working`. But a stuck session is stuck *inside a
tool call*; it is not deciding whether to invoke a CLI. Self-report cannot cover the
failure mode in which self-report is what broke. That case needs a daemon-side
actuator or nothing.

**Rejected — unreliable, therefore corrosive** (the decisive one). Claude would call
it only sometimes. A signal that is only sometimes emitted destroys the meaning of
its own absence: with ten sessions listed, you could no longer read a quiet row as
"nothing to report" rather than "didn't bother". That degrades the derived `!` sitting
next to it. Derived signals have no such failure mode — the daemon ticks every 2s
regardless of what Claude feels like doing.

**Decided:** sessions stay *observed*, never participants. Nothing Claude does
reaches herd except through the five hooks, and attention stays derived-only.

That settles the question `paged_at` / `paged_level` / `W6b_paged` were holding open.
They were schema and SQL with no production caller — `paged_level` was structurally
always `0`, so the preview could only ever print `(rung 0)` — kept warm for an
actuator that is now decided against. Deleted, same as the write-only events table
([#events](#events)). If a daemon-side notifier is ever built it brings its own
columns; keeping dead ones warm bought nothing but a misleading render.

**Protects:** attention being a binary armed/acked signal, the absence of any
session→herd channel, and `test_pager_actuator_stays_deleted` in
`tests/test_source_invariants.py`.

## 2026-07-18 — Ack is a timer restart, not a delete {#ack}

`ack_at` had been written on every jump since focus landed, and read by nothing:
the CLI rendered `!` from `attention_at` alone and the daemon's armed-check was
`session_pk IS NOT NULL`. Jumping did nothing visible.

**Considered and rejected:** have the jump delete the attention row. `W6d_rearm` is
a whole-row `DELETE`, so it discards `ack_at`; the next tick then measures silence
from the unchanged `last_event_at` — still past threshold — and re-arms. Measured as
a flap on every tick, ~2s apart, forever.

**Also rejected:** have the jump advance `last_event_at`. That is Claude's activity
clock and a jump is not Claude activity; writing it would corrupt the very signal
attention is derived from (see [two clocks](#clocks)).

**Decided:** an acked row stays in `herd_attention`. The CLI hides `!` while
`ack_at` is set, and the daemon re-notifies once a full status threshold of silence
has passed *since the ack*. Ack is a snooze, not a dismissal.

**Protects:** the third branch in `attention_tick`, and the fact that acked rows are
not deleted. Deleting them is the flap.

## 2026-07-18 — A failed write must not read as an adoption miss {#w5-rc}

`statusline.sh` gated Path C on `[ "$CH" != "1" ]`, where `CH` is the output of
`run W5_statusline "SELECT changes();"`. That output is `0` when the statement
**succeeded and matched no row**, but empty when it **failed** — and `!= "1"` reads
both as "not adopted". So a locked DB spent the 3s `busy_timeout`, then ran an
adopt, then retried W5, for three serial timeouts:

```
before:  9.046s, 3× "database is locked (5)" in the errlog
after:   3.023s, 1×
```

Measured with a competing `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` held across the render. This is the
hot path — the statusline fires ~1/sec per session, and the fingerprint cache
cannot absorb it because cost and context move every tick — so the amplification
landed hardest exactly when the DB was already contended.

**Decided:** capture `run`'s exit status separately and require `rc == 0 && CH == 0`
before attempting adoption. A failure means we learned *nothing* about whether the
row is adopted; the only correct response is to skip the DB work and render from
the payload, which the hook can always do.

**The same bug lived in `session_start.sh`**, where the cost was correctness rather
than latency. `ADOPTED=$(run W2_adopt "SELECT changes();")` fell through to
`W2b_insert` on a failure, inserting a SECOND row for a window the spawn reservation
already held — so the live session had no `job_name` and `herd jump <job>` could
never find it again. Reproduced under a held write lock:

```
id 1  session_id NULL       job_name api    <- reservation, orphaned
id 2  session_id sid-real   job_name NULL   <- duplicate, unnamed forever
```

There the fix is to **defer**, not to insert: on a failed adopt we have learned
nothing, and statusline Path C retries the same `(socket, window_id)` about once a
second, so the row is claimed as soon as the lock clears — well inside W3f's
stranded-sweep grace.

**Protects:** the `RC` capture in `statusline.sh` and the `W2_RC` guard in
`session_start.sh`. Collapsing either back to a test on the output alone restores
the stall / the duplicate. `test_a_failing_db_is_not_retried_as_an_adoption_miss`
asserts the DB-error *count*, not wall-clock, so it stays deterministic and free —
a corrupt DB reaches the same branch instantly that a locked one reaches slowly.
`test_a_genuine_adoption_miss_still_adopts` holds the other side: a healthy DB
reporting 0 changes must still adopt.

## 2026-07-18 — A failed `ps` must not read as an empty machine {#ps-floor}

`read_proc_table` ignored `ps`'s exit status. `_dead()` treats absence from the
table as death, so any `ps` failure — nonzero exit, fork limit, `ps` missing from
PATH under systemd — produced `{}` and reaped **every live session in one tick**.
A missing `ps` additionally killed the daemon with an uncaught `FileNotFoundError`.

**Decided:** return `None` rather than `{}` on a nonzero exit, an `OSError`, or an
unparseable table, and skip the reap for that tick. A real `ps -eo` always lists at
least the daemon itself, so an empty parse means the probe failed.

**Protects:** the `procs is not None` guard in `run()`. Reintroducing "just parse
whatever came back" restores a one-tick total wipe.

## 2026-07-18 — Reserve before launch {#toctou}

`herd spawn` originally ran `check R_job_live -> kitten @ launch -> INSERT`. The
launch is a subprocess plus a socket round trip — tens to hundreds of milliseconds
between the check and the write — so two spawns of one name both passed the check
and both inserted. Nothing corrupted, but the handle became ambiguous: `resolve()`
returned two rows, so `herd jump api` opened the picker instead of jumping, which is
exactly the scriptability the unique-match branch exists to provide.

**No index can catch this.** `job_name` must repeat across dead rows (that is what
makes names recyclable), so a plain `UNIQUE` is out. The constraint you want is
unique-among-live, but liveness is `sessions.stopped_at` while the name lives in
`herd_sessions`, and a SQLite partial index cannot reference another table. The
denormalized `live` column that would have made it expressible is the one removed in
[2026-07-16](#live-column).

**Decided:** make the claim atomic in code — `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, re-check, insert with
`window_id` NULL, commit; then launch and stamp the window. Taking the write lock
*before* the check is the whole trick: the loser blocks, then sees the winner's row.

A later fix (same day) found the error handler could itself raise: `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
is inside the `try`, so an unconditional `ROLLBACK` in the `except` threw
`cannot rollback - no transaction is active` and crashed the CLI it existed to
protect. Roll back only when `conn.in_transaction`.

**Protects:** `R_job_live` running *inside* the transaction, and the conditional
rollback. Moving the check before `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` reopens the race.

## 2026-07-18 — The events table was write-only {#events}

herd appended every lifecycle event to an `events` table. Nothing ever read it —
the signal is `sessions.last_event_at` — so it was clutter with a hazard attached:
with two writes, a guard on one and not the other would let `events` and `sessions`
silently disagree, and only `sessions` is read.

**Decided:** removed. One lifecycle write (`W4_event`). Historical/analytics needs
are served ad-hoc by parsing the per-session JSONL transcript
(`sessions.transcript_path`).

`PRAGMA auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL` in `core.sql` was added for this table's churn and
outlived it — nothing else grows unboundedly and no `incremental_vacuum` is ever
called.

**Protects:** the single-lifecycle-write rule. A second event sink brings the
divergence hazard back.

## 2026-07-18 — Nothing keeps its own transcription of a write path {#transcription}

The predecessor re-typed statements inline in each hook; **four defects survived 40
checks** that way. Later, the CLI briefly kept two hand-written copies of the list
query: `R1_list` sat unused while the CLI's private copy missed the
`idx_sessions_live` plan the query test had been guarding all along.

**Decided:** every write and the one live read are named `-- :name` blocks in
`writes.sql`, loaded by both `herd.db.load_statements()` (python) and `common.sh`'s
`stmt()` (awk). The suite asserts the two extract the same text.

**Protects:** `test_hooks.py::test_bash_and_python_extract_same` and
`test_source_invariants.py::test_no_hook_inlines_dml`. Any inline SQL is the rot
these exist to prevent.

## 2026-07-18 — `ctrl-q` needs `--expect`, not a bind {#expect}

`herd watch` re-enters fzf on every exit, so quitting has to be distinguishable from
cancelling. **Every other exit collapses into Esc's outcome:** `abort` exits 130 with
empty stdout, so a `ctrl-q:abort` bind is indistinguishable from a cancel and `watch`
just loops. That shipped broken.

ctrl-c is worse than it looks: fzf puts the terminal in raw mode, which disables
ISIG, so ctrl-c never becomes a SIGINT — fzf reads the raw `0x03` itself.
`cmd_watch` still catches `KeyboardInterrupt`, but that only covers the "no live
sessions" sleep, where no fzf is running. fzf 0.44.1 has no `print(...)` action, so
`--expect` is the only route.

**Protects:** both quit keys going through `--expect`. A bind-based "simplification"
makes the dashboard unquittable.

## 2026-07-18 — Three measured facts about the poker {#poker}

- **`--listen=0` is not usable here.** fzf's `start` event does not reliably see
  `$FZF_PORT`, so a `start:execute-silent(… poke &)` bind spawned the poker on one
  picker and not the next — auto-refresh worked intermittently. `watch` picks the
  port itself (`_free_port`), which also makes it the poker's parent, so it can reap
  it in a `finally` instead of orphaning one per jump.
- **Reload only on change.** An unconditional 2s reload redraws the pane for nothing;
  the poker diffs the row text first.
- **But contact fzf every tick anyway** (`data=None` → a liveness GET). A poker that
  only spoke on change could not notice its fzf had exited while the herd was quiet.
  Early failures are tolerated (`_POKE_GRACE`): `watch` spawns the poker before fzf
  has bound the port, and treating that startup window as death killed auto-refresh
  outright.

**Protects:** the self-chosen port, the change diff, and the grace window.

## 2026-07-17 — pid comes from the ancestry walk; SPIKE-1 overturned {#spike1}

SPIKE-1 (a scratch document, never in this repo) concluded that Claude's pid had to
come from `kitten @ ls`. Verified live and overturned: the **blocking** SessionStart
hook is a live descendant of claude, so exactly one claude is an ancestor — other
sessions' claudes and claude's own MCP children are siblings, never on the upward
path. First-match-walking-up wins with no ppid cross-check.

Meaningful **only from a blocking hook**: an async hook can be reparented to init
(ppid → 1), breaking the chain.

**Protects:** `claude_pid()` / `_walk_claude()` in `common.sh`, and SessionStart's
registration as blocking.

## 2026-07-16 — The denormalized `live` column and its trigger {#live-column}

`sessions` carried a `live` column maintained by a trigger. It produced a permanent
desync on resume — the trigger fired on death and nothing reset it when a resume
revived the session — and it was the *only* reason tier 2 reached into tier 1.

**Decided:** removed. "Is this window/job held by a live session?" is a JOIN to
`sessions.stopped_at`. Recyclability of window/job handles falls out for free, which
is why the lookup indexes are plain and non-unique.

**Cost, accepted knowingly:** unique-among-live becomes inexpressible as an index,
which is what forced the code-level reservation in [spawn](#toctou).

**Protects:** `test_source_invariants.py::test_no_live_denormalization_column` and
`test_core_declares_no_triggers`.

## 2026-07-16 — Two mirrored ways to destroy the idle signal {#clocks}

Both were hit for real:

1. **Rendering `updated_at` as idle** (the predecessor did this). Statusline stamps
   it ~1/sec, so the column reads ~0s forever and the signal is worthless.
2. **Gating a lifecycle `UPDATE` on the status changing.** `post_tool_use.sh` is the
   hot path and always passes `status='working'`, so an `AND status IS NOT :status`
   guard suppressed the entire update — including `last_event_at`. Measured: **5
   consecutive tool calls matched 0 rows**, `last_event_at` never moved, and the
   silence rule then paged about a *busy* session.

**Rule that falls out:** any suppressor must gate on nothing that carries a clock.
This is why `W4_event` has no status guard.

**Protects:** `W4_event`'s lack of a status guard, and `statusline.sh` never touching
`last_event_at`.

## 2026-07-16 — Config via default-expansion only {#runtime}

`HERD_RUNTIME` was written once as an unconditional `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}`
assignment. It ignored the test's override and wrote throttle state into the real
`/run`, so a check passed on first run and failed on every run after.

**Decided:** every knob is `${X:-default}`, never unconditional assignment.
`HERD_DB=/tmp/x ./hook.sh` must write where told, or the tests cannot redirect the
program's state and end up testing the machine.

**Protects:** the redirectability every hook test depends on.

## 2026-07-16 — An awk fork beats pure bash for `stmt()` {#awk}

Measured: **0.7ms for the awk fork, 1.6ms for the pure-bash equivalent.** The
intuition that avoiding a fork is always cheaper is wrong at this size.

`stmt()` also stops at the first `;` for a second reason beyond parser symmetry:
prose after a statement contains things like `:pid MUST be …` that `bind()` would
otherwise try to substitute.

**Protects:** the awk implementation, and the first-`;` cut.

## 2026-07-17 — kitty `--match pid:N` matches the wrong pid {#kitty-match}

Measured: `--match pid:N` matches the *window's* pid (the login shell), never the
foreground claude. So herd resolves pid → window itself and focuses by `--match id:`.

Match values are **unanchored regexes** — `job` matches `job-2`, and `title:herd`
also hits `herd-2`. Anchor them. This also bit the documented kitty keybinding
recipe, where a `--type=background` launch gets no `KITTY_LISTEN_ON` and every
`kitten @` in the script fails silently, making the key look dead.

**Protects:** the `id:`-based focus path and every anchored `--match` in the docs.
